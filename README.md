# Real-Time Facial Recognition in Exam Proctoring Applications
## CS691-Spring2025-Team - 9 Capstone Project

Real-Time Facial Recognition in Exam Proctoring Applications addresses the critical challenge of maintaining academic integrity in online education environments. This project aims to develop an affordable, accessible proctoring system that uses facial recognition technology to authenticate student identity at exam start, continuously monitor presence during assessments, detect suspicious behaviors like unusual gaze patterns, and identify unauthorized individuals in the testing environment. The solution balances effective monitoring with important considerations for privacy, data security, and algorithmic fairness, making reliable proctoring technology accessible to educational institutions regardless of budget constraints. By focusing on both integrity and accessibility, this project helps democratize quality remote assessment tools in an increasingly digital educational landscape.
