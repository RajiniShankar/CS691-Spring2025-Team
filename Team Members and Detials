# Hypothesis:


# Technologies We Plan to Use:

  # Model Technologies:

# 1. OpenSeeFace
   - Tracks eyes, head position, and gaze movement.
   - Can detect if someone turns away or looks at another screen.
   - Uses Dlib + OpenCV and runs efficiently on CPU.

# 2. Dlib
   - A modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms for face detection and landmark estimation.
   - Used for head pose estimation in real-time applications.

# 3. OpenCV
   - An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
   - Used for image processing tasks, such as reading video frames and performing transformations.


# Web Application Technologies:

# 1. Backend Framework
   - Flask or FastAPI: Lightweight Python web frameworks suitable for serving machine learning models and handling HTTP requests.

# 2. Real-Time Communication
   - WebSockets: Enables real-time, two-way communication between the client and server, essential for live video streaming and interaction.

# 3. Frontend Technologies
   - HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Standard web technologies for building the user interface.
   - WebRTC: Enables real-time communication of audio, video, and data in web applications.

# 4. Deployment
   - Docker: Containerization platform to package the application and its dependencies.
   - NGINX: A web server that can be used as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
